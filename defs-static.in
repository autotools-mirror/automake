# IMPORTANT NOTES AND REQUIREMENTS
#   - Multiple inclusions of this file should be idempotent.
#   - This code has to be 'set -e' clean.
#   - This file should execute correctly with any system's /bin/sh
#     shell, not only with configure-time detected $SHELL and/or
#     $AM_TEST_RUNNER_SHELL.

# Be more Bourne compatible.
# (Snippet inspired to configure's initialization in Autoconf 2.64)
