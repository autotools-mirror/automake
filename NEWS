Bugs fixed in 1.7.1a:
* Fix ansi2knr rules for LIBOBJS sources.
* Clean all known Texinfo index files, not only those which appear to
  be used, because we cannot know wich indexes are used in included files.
  (PR/375, Debian Bug #168671)
* Honor only the first @setfilename seen in a Texinfo file.
* Treat "required file X not found" diagnostics as errors (exit status 1).
* Don't complain that a required file is not found when it is a Makefile
  target. (PR/357)
* Don't use single suffix inference rules when building `.info'-less
  Info files, for the sake of Solaris make.
* The `check' target now depends on `$(BUILT_SOURCES)'. (PR/359)
* Recognize multiple inference rules such as `.a.b .c.d:'. (PR/371)
* Warn about multiple inference rules when -Wportability is used. (PR/372)
* Fix building of deansified files from subdirectories. (PR/370)
* Add missing `fi' in the .c->.obj rules.
* Improve install-sh to work even when names contain spaces or certain
  (but not all) shell metachars.
* Fix the following spurious failures in the test suite:
  gnits2.test, gnits3.test, python3.test, texinfo13.test

Bugs fixed in 1.7.1:
* Honor `ansi2knr' for files built in subdirectories, or using per-targets
  flags.
* Aclocal should now recognize macro names containing parentheses, e.g.
  AC_DEFUN([AC_LANG_PREPROC(Fortran 90)], [...]).
* Erase *.sum and *.log files created by DejaGnu, during `make distclean'.
  (Debian Bug#153697)
* Install Python files even if they were built.  (PR/369)
* Have stamp-vti dependent upon configure instead of configure.ac, as the
  version might not be defined in the latter. (PR/358)
* Reorder arguments passed to a couple of commands, so things works
  when POSIXLY_CORRECT=1.
* Fix a regex that can cause Perl to segfault on large input.
  (Debian Bug#162583)
* Fix distribution of packages that have some sources defined conditionally,
  as in the `Conditional compilation using Automake conditionals' example
  of the manual.
* Fix spurious test suite failures on IRIX.
* Don't report a required variable as undefined if it has been
  defined conditionally for the "right" conditions.
* Fix cleaning of the /tmp subdirectory used by `make distcheck', in case
  `make distcheck' fails.
* Fix distribution of included Makefile fragment, so we don't create
  spurious directories in the distribution. (PR/366)
* Don't complain that a target lacks `.$(EXEEXT)' when it has it.

New in 1.7:
* Autoconf 2.54 is required.
* `aclocal' and `automake' will no longer warn about obsolete
  configure macros.  This is done by `autoconf -Wobsolete'.
* AM_CONFIG_HEADER, AM_SYS_POSIX_TERMIOS and
  AM_HEADER_TIOCGWINSZ_NEEDS_SYS_IOCTL are obsolete (although still
  supported).  You should use AC_CONFIG_HEADERS, AC_SYS_POSIX_TERMIOS,
  and AC_HEADER_TIOCGWINSZ instead.  `autoupdate' can upgrade
  `configure.ac' for you.
* Support for per-program and per-library `_CPPFLAGS'.
* New `ctags' target (builds CTAGS files).
* Support for -Wmumble and -Wno-mumble, where mumble is a warning category
  (see `automake --help' or the manual for a list of them).
* Honor the WARNINGS environment variable.
* Omit the call to depcomp when using gcc3: call the compiler directly.
* A new option, std-options, tests that programs support --help and --version
  when `make installcheck' is run.  This is enabled by --gnits.
* Texinfo rules now support the `ps' and `pdf' targets.
* Info files are now created in the build directory, not the source directory.
* info_TEXINFOS supports files in subdirectories (this requires Texinfo 4.1
  or greater).
* `make distcheck' will enforce DESTDIR support by attempting
  a DESTDIR install.
* `+=' can be used in conditionals, even if the augmented variable
  was defined for another condition.
* Makefile fragments (inserted with `include') are always distributed.
* Use Autoconf's --trace interface to inspect configure.ac and get
  a more accurate view of it.
* Add support for extending aclocal's default macro search path
  using a `dirlist' file within the aclocal directory.
* automake --output-dir is deprecated.
* The part of the distcheck target that checks whether uninstall actually
  removes all installed files has been moved in a separate target,
  distuninstallcheck, so it can be overridden easily.
* Many bug fixes.

New in 1.6:
* Autoconf 2.52 is required.
* automake no longer run libtoolize.
  This is the job of autoreconf (from GNU Autoconf).
* `dist' generates all the archive flavors, as did `dist-all'.
* `dist-gzip' generates the Gzip tar file only.
* Combining Automake Makefile conditionals no longer lead to a combinatorial
  explosion.  Makefile.in's keep a reasonable size.
* AM_FUNC_ERROR_AT_LINE, AM_FUNC_STRTOD, AM_FUNC_OBSTACK, AM_PTRDIFF_T
  are no longer shipped, since Autoconf 2.52 provides them (both as AM_
  and AC_).
* `#line' of Lex and Yacc files are properly set.
* EXTRA_DIST can contain generated directories.
* Support for dot-less extensions in suffix rules.
* The part of the distcheck target that checks whether distclean actually
  cleans all built files has been moved in a separate target, distcleancheck,
  so it can be overridden easily.
* `make distcheck' will pass additional options defined in
  $(DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS) to configure.
* Fixed CDPATH portability problems, in particular for MacOS X.
* Fixed handling of nobase_ targets.
* Fixed support of implicit rules leading to .lo objects.
* Fixed late inclusion of --add-missing files (e.g. depcomp) in DIST_COMMON
* Added uninstall-hook target
* `AC_INIT AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(tarname,version)' is an obsolete construct.
  You can now use `AC_INIT(pkgname,version) AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE' instead.
  (Note that "pkgname" is not "tarname", see the manual for details.)
  It is also possible to pass a list of global Automake options as
  first argument to this new form of AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE.
* Compiler-based assembler is now called `CCAS'; people expected `AS'
  to be a real assembler.
* AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE will set STRIP itself when it needs it.  Adding
  AC_CHECK_TOOL([STRIP], [strip]) manually is no longer required.
* aclocal and automake are also installed with the version number
  appended, and some of the install directory names have changed.
  This lets you have multiple versions installed simultaneously.
* Support for parsers and lexers in subdirectories.

New in 1.5:
* Support for `configure.ac'.
* Support for `else COND', `endif COND' and negated conditions `!COND'.
* `make dist-all' is much faster.
* Allows '@' AC_SUBSTs in macro names.

* User-side dependency tracking.  Developers no longer need GNU make

  For instance, a _DATA file can appear in a subdir

* Support for latest autoconf, including support for objext
* Can now put `.' in SUBDIRS to control build order
* `include' command and `+=' support for macro assignment
* Dependency tracking no long susceptible to deleted header file problem
* Maintainer mode now a conditional.  @MAINT@ is now an anachronism.
* Bug fixes

New in 1.3:
* Bug fixes
* Better Cygwin32 support
* Support for suffix rules with _SOURCES variables
